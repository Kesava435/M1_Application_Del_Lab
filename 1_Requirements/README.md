# Features 
Digital Electronics LAB ,Student who's background from "computer science, Electronics,Electrical ".They definetely go through digital electronics lab in their Engineering.But some students who joined college's in covid pandemic they don't access their labs .So, i think this useful to students to access there from home using there  electronics gadgets
# Art of work
* This is properly for education purpose.
* It completes shows list of experiments.
* throught experiments student can learn basics of the subject.
# 4W'S and 1H
student can understand for what purpose they do ,why they learn,where to apply ,whom to they share knowledge,How to use
# SWOT Analysis
 ## STRENGTHS
 * Develops knowledge
 * improves analyatical skills.
