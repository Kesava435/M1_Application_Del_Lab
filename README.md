# M1_Application_Del_Lab
Digital Electronics LAB,Student who's background from "computer science, Electronics,Electrical ".They definetely go through digital electronics lab in their Engineering.But some students who joined college's in covid pandemic they don't access their labs .So, i think this useful to students access from  home using  there  laptops or mobiles.
## Aim of this project
 To create Digital Electronics lab for easy access to the students.
## Overview
* The project deals with the interfacing of Digital Electronics labs
* Firstly student need to enter the NAME.
* It contains list of experiments to do by students.
* Then select first experiment to do.
* Now select second experiment to do.
* If first complete it goes to second other wise not getting second experimrnt.
* After completion it shows lab experiments is completed
## Requirements 
* It requires student name
* list of the experiments we implement.
## Features
* It gives basic idea about the digital electronics lab.
* student capable to understand why this lab to use.
