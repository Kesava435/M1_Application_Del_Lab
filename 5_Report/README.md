# APPLICATION FOR DIGITAL ELECTRONICS LAB
 Digital Electronics LAB,Student who's background from "computer science, Electronics,Electrical ".They definetely go through digital electronics lab in their Engineering.But some students who joined college's in covid pandemic they don't access their labs .So, i think this useful to students access from  home using  there  laptops or mobiles.
## Aim of this project
 To create Digital Electronics lab for easy access to the students.
## Overview
* The project deals with the interfacing of Digital Electronics labs
* Firstly student need to enter the NAME.
* It contains list of experiments to do by students.
* Then select first experiment to do.
* Now select second experiment to do
* If first complete it goes to second other wise not getting second experimrnt.
* After completion it shows lab experiments is completed
## Requirements 
* It requires student name
* list of the experiments we implement.
## Features
* It gives basic idea about the digital electronics lab.
* student capable to understand why this lab to use.
### list of the experiments
   1.AND gate
   2.OR gate
   3.NOT gate
   4.NAND gate
   5.NOR gate
### AND gate
The AND gate gives an output of 1 if both the two inputs are 1, it gives 0 otherwise.

### OR gate
The OR gate gives an output of 1 if either of the two inputs are 1, it gives 0 otherwise.

### NOT gate
It acts as an inverter. It takes only one input. If the input is given as 1, it will invert the result as 0 and vice-versa.

### NAND gate
The NAND gate (negated AND) gives an output of 0 if both inputs are 1, it gives 1 otherwise.

### NOR gate
The NOR gate (negated OR) gives an output of 1 if both inputs are 0, it gives 1 otherwise.
